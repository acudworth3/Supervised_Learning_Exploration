PAPER elements
-description of classification problems
    -Ecamine data

x   -Train/Test error for all algorithims + datasets
x   -Train/Test error as a function of training size
        -via plot learning curve
        -TODO add roc curve
        -TODO maybe aplly this to train and test 
        -maybe a precision recall graph

-Train/Test error as a function of iterations (google learning curves)??? read a little more about this


-why did you get the results that you did?
-Changes to improve performance?
-wall clock time
-Would cross validation help (implement it)
-View performance of various hyper parameters


-which algorithim performed best
-compare and constrast the algorithims
-How much performance was due to problem chosen
    -explore VC dims?
-be creative

after dinner
-read 


TODO BEFORE SUBMIT
x   -example DATA RECORD (in intro)
x   -model training accuracy
x   -model training ROC
x   -get rid of model performance chart
-sources/citations
x   -vary hyperparams
-write Readme.md/organize code
