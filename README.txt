Code is located at 
https://github.com/acudworth3/Supervised_Learning_Exploration.git

sklearn and numpy are used heavily and cited througout analysis. 
All Neccessary libraries are in requirenments.txt 
heavily used refrences:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_learning_curve.html


acudworth3-analysis.pdf contains the analysis of learning models

Original Data:
https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data (airbnb)
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand (Poker Data)


Prefixes generally mean what they imply:
    KNN: K Nearest Neighbors
    DT: Decision Tree
    SVM: Support Vector Machine
    NN: Neural Net

    ab: "Airbnb Data"
    pk/pkr: "Poker Data"

FOLDERS:
Data: contains the data
Final Models:  contains models generated by grid searches broken up by roc vs accuracy
Final Plots: Original Copies of all plots used in analysis

RUN: All files needed to generate plots and models organically
RUN contents
    Important Files:
        -These files initiate and clean the data to reflect the description in 
        the Classification Problem section of the apper
        -They do not need to be edited, but are important

        Models.py
        preprocess.py
    
    Grid Searches:
        -Each file runs the grid search for prospective model in figure 2
        -NOTE these files take along time to run
        -for any file run "python FILENAME"
        
        KNN_iso.py
        SVM_iso.py
        NN_iso.py
        DT_iso.py
        DT_ada_iso.py
    
    Hyper Parameter Variation:
        -for any file run "python FILENAME"
        
        KNN_hyper_var.py: varies K to produce Figure 5
        DT_hyper_var_pruning.py: vary alpha to produce figure 8
        DT_hyper_var.py: vary class weight to produce figure 9        
        DT_ada_hyper_var.py: vary class weight to produce figure 10
        DT_ada_hyper_var.py: vary class weight to produce figure 11
        NN_hyper_var.py: vary hidden layer size to produce figure 14
        SVM_hyper_var_kernel.py vary kernel for results in table 4
        
    Model Learning Curves
        learning_curve_all.py : generates all learning curves except SVM
        learning_curve_SVM.py : generates SVM learning curves
    
        -NOTE verbose output
        
    Misc Plots:
        -for any file run "python FILENAME"
        data_explore.py: Figure 1 exploring airbnb data
        dummy_plot.py: Figure 2 Comparing Model Performance
